          <h1>About us</h1>
            <p> <strong>TIMEAPP </strong> is an educational platform for families to manage data and ‘screen time’ in a positive, constructive way by teaching and encouraging children to manage it as a resource. No more arguments, with <strong>TIMEAPP </strong> managing ‘screen time’ is a fun, family-oriented and skills-building activity. </p1>
              <h2> <em> What are we solving for? </em> <h2>
                <h3>
              <p> Parents who wish to limit their children’s ‘screen-time’ find it to be a painful process, as they feel it often leads to never-ending fights. Furthermore, every parent wants their children to do their house chores, homework and other tasks. Disciplining your child feels like endless negotiations.
                      In addition, clinical studies show that screens increase depression, anxiety and aggression. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 8- to 10 year-olds spend 8 hours a day with various digital media while teenagers spend 11 hours in front of screens. The immersive and addictive world of screens dampens and stunts children’s developmental processes.</p2> <h3>
                  <h4> <em> How does it work? </em> <h4>
                    <p> The parent sets up a monthly limit, and in early ages TimeApp will schedule for the child screen time, while in older ages the child would be able to schedule and manage it. The life-skill of knowing how to manage one’s resources has been linked to later success in life, increasing the child’s ability to achieve his or hers goals. Instead of limiting a child screen time, TIMEAPP shows them the proper way to ‎earn and save. Through practiced exercises, children learn tangible ways to manage their media consumption independently and be responsible to their own time.</p3>
